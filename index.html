                            The Dvorak keyboard was designed over the course of
                            more than a decade of research on language and
                            typing habits. It endeavors to place common keys in
                            easy-to-reach positions to maximize speed and
                            comfort.

                        <p>
                            Common letters should be placed on the home row and
                            rare letters on the bottom row. This makes typing
                            easier, quicker, and less awkward.

                            It's also important that a keyboard forces you to
                            alternate hands. This allows each hand to prepare
                            for the next keystroke, and lessens the strain on an
                            individual hand.

                                Dvorak typists began to sweep typing speed
                                contests two years later, and they have held
                                most typing records ever since. A large-scale
                                comparative test of several thousand children,
                                carried out in the Tacoma schools in the 1930s,
                                showed that children learned Dvorak typing in
                                one- third the time required to attain the same
                                standard with QWERTY typing. When the U.S. Navy
                                faced a shortage of trained typists in World War
                                II, it experimented with retraining QWERTY
                                typists to use Dvorak. The retraining quickly
                                enabled the Navy’s test typists to increase
                                their typing accuracy by 68 percent and their
                                speed by 74 percent. Faced with these convincing
                                results, the Navy ordered thousands of Dvorak
                                typewriters.<br /><br />
                                They never got them. The Treasury Department
                                vetoed the Navy purchase order, probably for the
                                same reason that has blocked acceptance of all
                                improved, non-QWERTY keyboards for the last 80
                                years: the commitment to QWERTY of tens of
                                millions of typists, teachers, salespeople,
                                office managers, and manufacturers. Even when
                                daisy wheels and computer printers replaced type
                                bars, forever banishing the jamming problem that
                                had originally motivated QWERTY, manufacturers
                                of the efficient new technologies carried on the
                                inefficient old keyboard. August Dvorak died in
                                1975, a bitter man: I’m tired of trying to do
                                something worthwhile for the human race, he
                                complained. They simply don’t want to change!

                                Indeed, Dvorak's layout never got the necessary
                                momentum to replace the status quo.

                                the U.S. population is estimated to use the

                            Studies have shown that despite the claimed
                            superiority of the Dvorak layout,
                            <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-qwerty-truth/"

                            >
                            largely prevented the switch from happening.
                            Economics classes frequently use the Dvorak layout
                            as an argument that free markets do not always
                            settle on the 'best' option.

                            Though, the choice to stick with QWERTY certainly
                            seems more convenient.

                            RIP Dvorak. Perhaps one day the human race will deem
                            it worthwhile to change how we lay out our
                            keyboards... though that could very well be the day
                            we stop using keyboards entirely.
